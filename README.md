# PIACERE DOML

PIACERE DevSecOps Modelling Language.

The [*PIACERE*][piacere-project] project has developed a DevSecOps Modelling Language (DOML), aiming at describing cloud applications that are agnostic of the specificities of the different providers and IaC tools used for provisioning, deployment and configuration.  
DOML provides several modeling perspectives in a multi-layer approach. An application can be described in four layers: application layer, abstract / concrete infrastructure layer and optimization layer.  
It allows developers to describe how cloud applications are structured in an abstract manner, mapping the different software components to the concrete infrastructure elements, enabling the usage of different concretizations to match one particular deployment.

Users can find here a full **specification** document.   
The **tutorial** here presented comes in two different formats: a  DOML file,  which can be read  using the PIACERE IDE, and a Markdown file, which we suggest to read by using tools that can interpret the style HTML tag for readability reasons.
